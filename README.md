## Description
King of the Geo Hill (KGH) is a mobile application which takes a modern take on the classic "king of the hill" game. KGH uses [Radar's](https://radar.io/) API to check the occupancy of the "hill". On start up the user is prompted to either *create* or *join* a game. Upon creating a game they may share the game code with other players for them to join, as well as select their team. The game owner can start the clock, and for every second that the hill is occupied by your team, and only members of your team, your team scores a point. This can be integrated into other "mock war" games/sports such as aerosoft and paintball.
