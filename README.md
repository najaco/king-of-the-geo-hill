## Description
King of the Geo Hill (KGH) is a mobile application which takes a modern take on the classic "king of the hill" game. KGH uses [Radar's](https://radar.io/) API to check the occupancy of the "hill." Users create games and invite other players to help them take over the hill! Players are divided into red and blue teams and fight to gain sole control of the point. All the players have to do is download the app, create a game, share the code and start playing! KGH keeps track of players by using their phones locations after players enter in the game code. This app provides a fun and easy way to implement this popular video game mode in airsoft or paintball games.
